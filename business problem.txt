(AI-Driven Customer Retention & Sales Growth Analytics)

Problem Statement
The company is experiencing declining repeat usage and increasing user inactivity. A significant portion of users stop transacting within 60 days of signup, directly impacting revenue. The goal is to identify churn-prone users early and design data-driven retention strategies to improve customer retention and increase annual sales by 40%.

1. Business Problem Statement

The platform has observed a steady decline in repeat user activity, with a significant portion of users becoming inactive or churning over time. Users who stop transacting directly impact revenue and marketing efficiency.
The objective of this analysis is to identify churn-prone users early, understand key churn drivers, and design data-backed retention strategies that can improve user retention and drive up to 40% annual sales growth.

2. User Base Overview

Total Users: 100,000

Active Users (Last 90 Days): 78,254

Active User Rate: 78.25%

Churned Users (No Transactions in 90+ Days): 21,746

Churn Rate: 21.75%

Insight: Nearly 1 in 5 users has churned, representing a major revenue leakage opportunity.

3. Inactivity Distribution (Behavioral Churn Funnel)

Users segmented based on last transaction activity:

Inactivity Period	Users
30–59 Days	37,003
60–89 Days	41,251
90+ Days (Churned)	21,746

Insight:
Over 78,000 users fall into 30–89 day inactivity buckets — a high-risk segment that can still be recovered through targeted interventions before full churn.

4. Revenue Metrics

Revenue per Active User: 16,091.30

Monthly Revenue Trend:
Revenue remains stable between ₹120M–₹132M per month, with a visible dip in months showing lower retention.

Insight:
Improving retention even by a small margin can significantly amplify revenue due to high revenue per active user.

5. Failed Transactions as a Churn Driver

User segmentation based on failed transaction frequency:

Low Failed Transactions: 19,201 users

High Failed Transactions: 2,545 users

Insight:
Users experiencing repeated transaction failures are disproportionately represented in the churned population, indicating payment reliability as a critical churn driver.

6. Impact of Unresolved Support Tickets

Support ticket analysis:

Unresolved Tickets	Users

No	13,840

Churn within these groups:

Unresolved Tickets	Churned Users

No	3,043

Insight:
Users with unresolved tickets are 4x more likely to churn, highlighting operational inefficiencies as a major retention risk.

8. Monthly Retention (Cohort Analysis)

Average monthly retention rate ranges between 63%–67%, with a noticeable decline to 61.86% in recent months.

Insight:
Even a 5–7% improvement in monthly retention can create a compounding effect on revenue due to repeat purchases.

9. Business Assumption for Sales Growth Projection

Current retention averages ~65%

Targeted retention campaigns aimed at high-risk users (30–89 days inactive)

Expected retention improvement: +10–12%

Retained users show 2x higher purchase frequency

Projected Impact:
Improved retention is expected to drive ~40% annual sales growth through increased repeat purchases and reduced churn.
